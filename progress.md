## 2026-06-20 - Task: highlight current branch and HEAD commit
### What was done
- Added current repository HEAD SHA to the full state and lightweight ref state API so the UI can identify the real HEAD independently from the selected commit.
- Highlighted the checked-out branch in the left branch list and top branch strip, and added a `HEAD` badge plus row highlight for the current HEAD commit.
- Kept branch/Tag view switching on the lightweight `/api/ref-state` path so changing the viewed ref does not reload unrelated repository state.
- Updated the continuation document so another Codex session can see this feature is already complete.
### Testing
- Pending: run JavaScript syntax checks, API checks, and browser UI verification after implementation.
### Notes
- `server.js`: exposes `repo.headSha` from both `/api/state` and `/api/ref-state`, and serves the lightweight ref state endpoint.
- `public/app.js`: adds current branch/current HEAD detection and related classes/badges during rendering; `selectRef` now refreshes only repo/commit data through `/api/ref-state`.
- `public/styles.css`: styles current branch rows/chips and current HEAD commit rows without replacing the selected state.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the completed current branch and HEAD commit highlight feature.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in the files above, or reset this working tree to the commit before this task once the changes are committed.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: verify current branch and HEAD commit highlight
### What was done
- Verified the implementation against the real `D:\桌面\forkline-web` worktree on branch `codex/remote-latest`.
- Restarted the local Forkline service on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` so the running app uses the updated code.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- `/api/state` and `/api/ref-state?ref=` on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` both returned `repo.headSha = f83a9c2b0177`, and the commit list contained that SHA.
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` confirmed one `.branch-row.current-branch`, one `.branch-chip.current-branch`, and one `.commit-row.current-head` with a `.head-badge`; console errors/warnings were empty.
- Screenshot capture timed out in the browser automation layer, but DOM and console checks passed on the live page.
### Notes
- `server.js`: verified `repo.headSha` and `/api/ref-state` on the live service.
- `public/app.js`: verified current branch/current HEAD render classes and badge markup in the live page.
- `public/styles.css`: verified the live page applies the current branch and HEAD classes.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: verified the handoff note includes this feature.
- `progress.md`: appended this verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`; the live service can then be restarted on port 5177.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: auto-open browser on Windows server start
### What was done
- Added Windows-only automatic browser opening after the local server starts.
- Reused `execFile` through `cmd /c start` and kept non-Windows startup behavior unchanged.
- Documented the startup behavior in the continuation notes.
### Testing
- Pending: run server syntax check and verify the server still starts.
### Notes
- `server.js`: opens `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` automatically on Windows after `server.listen` succeeds.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that Windows startup now opens the local app URL automatically.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation record.
- Rollback: remove `openLocalAppInBrowser` and its call in `server.js`, then remove this startup note from `docs/CONTINUE.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: verify auto-open browser startup
### What was done
- Verified the Windows startup change with syntax checks and a temporary service start.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Temporary service `http://127.0.0.1:5290` started successfully, listened on port 5290, and `/api/state` returned sample repo state with `repo.headSha`.
- Existing service `http://127.0.0.1:5177` remained running while the temporary service was verified.
### Notes
- `server.js`: verified the server still starts after adding Windows auto-open.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: startup behavior remains documented.
- `progress.md`: appended this verification record.
- Rollback: revert the `server.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md` edits from this task; the temporary 5290 service was stopped.
