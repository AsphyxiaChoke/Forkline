## 2026-06-20 - Task: highlight current branch and HEAD commit
### What was done
- Added current repository HEAD SHA to the full state and lightweight ref state API so the UI can identify the real HEAD independently from the selected commit.
- Highlighted the checked-out branch in the left branch list and top branch strip, and added a `HEAD` badge plus row highlight for the current HEAD commit.
- Kept branch/Tag view switching on the lightweight `/api/ref-state` path so changing the viewed ref does not reload unrelated repository state.
- Updated the continuation document so another Codex session can see this feature is already complete.
### Testing
- Pending: run JavaScript syntax checks, API checks, and browser UI verification after implementation.
### Notes
- `server.js`: exposes `repo.headSha` from both `/api/state` and `/api/ref-state`, and serves the lightweight ref state endpoint.
- `public/app.js`: adds current branch/current HEAD detection and related classes/badges during rendering; `selectRef` now refreshes only repo/commit data through `/api/ref-state`.
- `public/styles.css`: styles current branch rows/chips and current HEAD commit rows without replacing the selected state.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the completed current branch and HEAD commit highlight feature.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in the files above, or reset this working tree to the commit before this task once the changes are committed.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: verify current branch and HEAD commit highlight
### What was done
- Verified the implementation against the real `D:\桌面\forkline-web` worktree on branch `codex/remote-latest`.
- Restarted the local Forkline service on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` so the running app uses the updated code.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- `/api/state` and `/api/ref-state?ref=` on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` both returned `repo.headSha = f83a9c2b0177`, and the commit list contained that SHA.
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5177` confirmed one `.branch-row.current-branch`, one `.branch-chip.current-branch`, and one `.commit-row.current-head` with a `.head-badge`; console errors/warnings were empty.
- Screenshot capture timed out in the browser automation layer, but DOM and console checks passed on the live page.
### Notes
- `server.js`: verified `repo.headSha` and `/api/ref-state` on the live service.
- `public/app.js`: verified current branch/current HEAD render classes and badge markup in the live page.
- `public/styles.css`: verified the live page applies the current branch and HEAD classes.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: verified the handoff note includes this feature.
- `progress.md`: appended this verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`; the live service can then be restarted on port 5177.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: auto-open browser on Windows server start
### What was done
- Added Windows-only automatic browser opening after the local server starts.
- Reused `execFile` through `cmd /c start` and kept non-Windows startup behavior unchanged.
- Documented the startup behavior in the continuation notes.
### Testing
- Pending: run server syntax check and verify the server still starts.
### Notes
- `server.js`: opens `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` automatically on Windows after `server.listen` succeeds.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that Windows startup now opens the local app URL automatically.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation record.
- Rollback: remove `openLocalAppInBrowser` and its call in `server.js`, then remove this startup note from `docs/CONTINUE.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: verify auto-open browser startup
### What was done
- Verified the Windows startup change with syntax checks and a temporary service start.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Temporary service `http://127.0.0.1:5290` started successfully, listened on port 5290, and `/api/state` returned sample repo state with `repo.headSha`.
- Existing service `http://127.0.0.1:5177` remained running while the temporary service was verified.
### Notes
- `server.js`: verified the server still starts after adding Windows auto-open.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: startup behavior remains documented.
- `progress.md`: appended this verification record.
- Rollback: revert the `server.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md` edits from this task; the temporary 5290 service was stopped.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: restore folder picker and improve merge graph readability
### What was done
- Restored the top-bar "选择" folder picker beside the repository path input.
- Fixed the path bar grid so the newly restored "选择" button does not force the "打开" button into a hidden second row.
- Added an internal directory browser modal with path jump, parent navigation, drive roots, and common shortcuts for desktop, downloads, documents, and user home.
- Added `/api/browse` so the UI can list local directories, identify Git repositories, and hide `.git` from the visible folder list.
- Widened the commit graph lane area and made merge commits easier to read with larger merge nodes, `M2` / `M3` parent-count labels, and dashed secondary-parent lines.
- Updated the continuation document so the restored picker and merge graph change are visible to future sessions.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Temporary HTTP/API verification returned `/api/browse` for `D:\桌面\forkline-web` with `isGit = true`, shortcuts `桌面,下载,文档,用户目录`, no `.git` entry, and the expected modal/button HTML.
- Browser preview verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5290/` confirmed the "选择" button opens the folder modal, shortcuts render, `.git` is hidden, and the merge graph contains `M2`, a dashed secondary-parent path, and `viewBox = 0 0 156 ...`.
- Browser layout verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5291/` confirmed `repoInput`, recent repo select, clear, "选择", "克隆", "初始化", and "打开" all remain on one row with no overlapping boxes at desktop width and at 1180px viewport width.
- Browser console errors/warnings were empty during the preview verification.
### Notes
- `server.js`: added the local directory browser helpers and `/api/browse`.
- `public/index.html`: restored the "选择" button and folder picker modal markup.
- `public/app.js`: wired folder picker state/events and enhanced merge graph rendering.
- `public/styles.css`: styled the folder picker and widened the graph column.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documented the restored folder picker and merge graph readability change.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`; no persistent test data was created.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: simplify workspace changes panel
### What was done
- Removed the duplicate left-sidebar workspace file list.
- Renamed the bottom unstaged changes area to "工作区" and moved the workspace file filter into that panel.
- Kept the existing workspace filtering behavior, including path/status matching, count display, and clear action.
- Updated the continuation document so future sessions know the workspace filter now lives in the bottom changes panel.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Static checks confirmed `worktreeList`, the old left `<section class="worktree">`, and `file-stack` are no longer referenced in `public/`.
- Live `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` verification confirmed the left sidebar only shows local and remote branches, the bottom panel title is "工作区", and the filter input is inside the bottom changes panel with no console errors.
- Temporary in-memory preview `http://127.0.0.1:5293/` verified sample workspace filtering: entering `workbench` reduced the change list to `src/styles/workbench.css`, showed `1/5`, and the clear button restored all 5 rows with no console errors. The preview server was stopped after testing.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: removed the old sidebar workspace block and placed the workspace filter in the bottom changes panel.
- `public/app.js`: removed the old sidebar list rendering path, renamed the unstaged section to "工作区", and keeps filter metadata synchronized during stage rendering.
- `public/styles.css`: removed obsolete sidebar workspace/file-stack styles and sized the bottom changes grid for the new filter row.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: updated the current feature note to say the workspace filter now lives in the bottom changes panel.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: redesign branch graph modes
### What was done
- Split the commit graph into two clearer modes: all-branch overview and single-branch focus.
- All-branch view keeps multiple lanes, branch labels, merge parent-count labels, and dashed secondary-parent merge lines so branch merge relationships are visible.
- Single-branch view now uses first-parent history and draws one main timeline; merge commits keep a side hint and "合并" label without expanding every merged side-branch commit into the branch view.
- Widened the graph column to make merge labels and branch lanes easier to read.
- Updated the continuation document with the new graph behavior.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Real Git command verification on `D:\桌面\GitTest` confirmed `git log --first-parent main` returns the main branch timeline while retaining merge commits.
- Browser preview verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5295/` confirmed all-branch view uses `graph-lines overview`, 2 lane guides, `M2`, and a dashed secondary-parent path.
- Browser preview verification confirmed switching to `main` uses `graph-lines focus`, one lane guide, 3 first-parent commits (`Merge feature/login`, `main update`, `base commit`), a side merge hint, and no console errors. The preview server was stopped after testing.
### Notes
- `server.js`: single-ref log requests now use `--first-parent`, and sample ref-state returns a first-parent style commit list.
- `public/app.js`: separates overview and focused graph rendering, keeps side-branch lanes in all-branch mode, and draws focused branch history as a mainline graph.
- `public/styles.css`: widens the graph column to match the new SVG width.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documents the new all-branch versus single-branch graph behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: remove merge text labels from graph
### What was done
- Removed the visible merge text labels from both all-branch and single-branch graph modes, so merge commits no longer show `M2`, `M3`, or "合并" next to the node.
- Kept merge commit nodes, overview merge curves, dashed secondary-parent lines, and single-branch side merge hints so merge relationships remain visible without extra text.
- Updated the continuation document to describe that merge commits are represented by nodes and lines instead of text labels.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Static assertion confirmed `mergeLabel`, `graph-merge-label`, and merge-label calls are gone from `public/app.js`, while merge nodes and branch merge hints remain.
- Browser validation was attempted through the in-app browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5296/` and `http://localhost:5296/`, but the browser client blocked localhost navigation with `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT`; this was not counted as a visual pass.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: removed merge text label rendering and the now-unused helper.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: updated the graph behavior note to say merge commits use nodes and lines rather than text labels.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`.

## 2026-06-20 - Task: align all-branch graph colors with branch colors
### What was done
- Updated all-branch graph layout so each lane keeps the branch name it represents and uses that branch's existing color instead of the lane index color.
- Updated overview lane guides and secondary merge-parent lines to use the represented branch color, keeping graph nodes, labels, and helper lines visually consistent with the branch list.
- Updated the continuation document so future sessions know graph colors are branch-color based.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Logic verification with a constructed branch order confirmed `main` uses `refColor("main")` even when it is rendered on lane 0, and no longer falls back to `laneColor(0)`.
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5301/` confirmed the app renders, the overview graph is present, `main` branch color is `#ff7a67`, the graph `main` label stroke is `#ff7a67`, overview lane guides include `#ff7a67`, and browser console errors/warnings are empty.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: records branch names during all-branch graph layout and derives overview graph colors from branch colors.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documents that all-branch graph colors now match branch list colors.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5301 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: keep top bar fixed and switch inspector tabs by selection context
### What was done
- Decoupled the top bar grid from the right inspector width so dragging the inspector only resizes the lower workspace and does not move the repository path area or top-right controls.
- Added a top-right "更多" selector for worktrees, submodules, stashes, recovery points, and operation logs.
- Updated the inspector tab rules so commit selection shows only "详情 / 文件 / 标签列表", worktree or staged file selection shows only "历史 / 逐行", and branch selection shows only "分支整理 / 同步情况 / 分支比较".
- Updated the continuation document with the new top-bar and inspector navigation behavior.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `node --check server.js` passed with the Codex runtime Node.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported existing LF-to-CRLF conversion warnings.
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5303/` confirmed dragging the right inspector changed the workspace grid from `190px 7px 816px 7px 260px` to `190px 7px 666px 7px 410px`, while topbar, repo bar, and actions coordinates stayed stable.
- Browser verification confirmed commit tabs show `详情, 文件, 标签列表`; file selection shows `历史, 逐行` with "文件历史" active; branch selection shows `分支整理, 同步情况, 分支比较`; selecting `操作日志` from "更多" hides the inspector tab row and opens the operation log panel.
- Browser page console errors/warnings were empty; the Browser plugin emitted unrelated Statsig network timeout messages outside the app page.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: added the top-right "更多" inspector selector and renamed visible inspector tab labels.
- `public/app.js`: added inspector context rules, context-aware tab filtering, file/branch/commit selection switching, and "更多" selection handling.
- `public/styles.css`: fixed the topbar grid, styled the "更多" selector, and hid inspector tabs in more-context panels.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documented fixed topbar and context-based inspector tabs.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5303 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: improve dark dropdown readability
### What was done
- Updated the top-right "更多" selector so the closed select and its native options use the dark panel background and light text in dark mode.
- Kept light mode on the browser's light color scheme so the same control remains readable there.
### Testing
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5304/` confirmed the app loads in dark mode, the "更多" selector can switch to "操作日志", and the right panel changes to the operation log view.
- Computed style verification confirmed both the select and the "操作日志" option use `rgb(29, 34, 43)` background, `rgb(231, 236, 243)` text, and dark `color-scheme`.
- Browser page console errors/warnings were empty.
### Notes
- `public/styles.css`: changed the "更多" selector and option colors for readable dark-mode dropdown text.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/styles.css` and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5304 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: fix more panel clipping in inspector
### What was done
- Fixed the right inspector content area so panels opened from the top-right "更多" selector occupy the full remaining inspector height instead of collapsing into the hidden tab row.
- Kept long "更多" panels scrollable inside the right sidebar, while normal commit detail tabs continue to show their tab row.
### Testing
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5305/` reproduced the issue before the fix: after selecting "操作日志", `#detailBody` was only `28px` high while the inspector had `588px` of available content space.
- Browser verification after the fix confirmed "操作日志" and "恢复点" both render with `#detailBody` at `588px` high, with long content scrolling inside the right sidebar.
- Browser verification confirmed the normal commit detail view still renders the tab row and `#detailBody` at `548px` high.
- Browser page console errors/warnings were empty.
### Notes
- `public/styles.css`: pins the inspector detail body to the third grid row so hiding the tab row does not collapse the content viewport.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/styles.css` and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5305 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: remove default worktree file highlight
### What was done
- Removed the automatic selection of the first worktree file when rendering the workspace change list.
- The work diff panel now stays in the "未选择文件" state until the user explicitly clicks a file.
- Manual file selection still highlights the clicked row, loads its diff, and switches the inspector to file history/blame tabs.
### Testing
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5306/` confirmed the initial workspace change list has no `.selected` or `.multi-selected` file row.
- Browser verification confirmed the diff panel initially shows "未选择文件".
- Browser verification confirmed clicking `src/views/HistoryPanel.tsx` selects only that row, loads `HistoryPanel.tsx · 未暂存`, and opens the file-history inspector tabs.
- Browser page console errors/warnings were empty.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: stops auto-selecting the first visible worktree file during stage rendering and only loads worktree diff after an explicit selection.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js` and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5306 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: clear worktree highlight on deselect
### What was done
- Updated worktree file selection so Ctrl-clicking an already selected file clears both the multi-select state and the focused file highlight.
- When the last selected worktree file is deselected, the work diff panel returns to "未选择文件" instead of keeping the previous file highlighted.
### Testing
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5307/` confirmed the initial worktree list has no selected rows and the diff panel shows "未选择文件".
- Browser verification confirmed clicking `src/views/HistoryPanel.tsx` selects and highlights that row, loads `HistoryPanel.tsx · 未暂存`, and opens file history.
- Browser verification confirmed Ctrl-clicking the same row clears both `.selected` and `.multi-selected`, empties the diff path, and restores the diff text to "未选择文件".
- Browser page console errors/warnings were empty.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: derives the focused worktree file from the current selection after each click, so deselection clears the visual highlight.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js` and `progress.md`; stop any temporary verification service on port 5307 if still running.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: move conflict choice buttons into conflict prompt
### What was done
- Removed all bottom Diff panel buttons except "最大化".
- Moved per-file conflict choice actions into the workspace conflict prompt, showing "当前 --ours" and "对方 --theirs" for each unresolved conflict file.
- Kept the existing file right-click conflict actions intact.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Search confirmed no visible bottom Diff action/scope selectors remain: `data-work-diff-action`, `data-work-diff-scope`, and `.work-diff-scope` are absent from `public/`.
- Browser verification on `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` confirmed the bottom Diff panel only has "最大化" and no console warnings/errors.
- Browser verification with a temporary merge-conflict repo confirmed the workspace conflict prompt renders `conflict.txt` with "当前 --ours" and "对方 --theirs" buttons, while the bottom Diff panel still only has "最大化".
- The temporary conflict repo was removed, and `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` was restored to `D:/桌面/GitTest` after verification.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: removed the old bottom Diff panel action/scope buttons and kept only the maximize button.
- `public/app.js`: renders conflict choice buttons inside the conflict prompt and routes them to the existing single-file conflict resolution action.
- `public/styles.css`: adds compact conflict choice row styling and removes unused bottom scope-button styling.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: updates the conflict-resolution usage note so future work looks for the buttons in the conflict prompt instead of the bottom Diff panel.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: optimize render performance and UI colors
### What was done
- Debounced commit search rendering so rapid typing no longer redraws the commit list and SVG graph on every keypress.
- Batched commit row insertion with a document fragment to reduce DOM append work on large histories.
- Refined the dark and light palettes, with clearer panel separation, selected commit rows, current HEAD rows, active branch chips, search focus state, active tabs, and hover states.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 after starting the local service.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns repository state successfully.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped after repeated 5177 page opens made the Codex session unstable; this task used static checks plus local HTTP/API verification instead.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: adds cancellable delayed commit search rendering and batches commit row DOM insertion.
- `public/styles.css`: updates color tokens and key active/selected/focus styles for clearer UI hierarchy.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the search performance and palette updates for future continuation.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: continue performance and UI color polish
### What was done
- Reduced redundant inspector rendering during commit list refreshes: full refresh and commit clicks now avoid double-rendering the right panel, and search refreshes only update the inspector when the selected commit actually changes.
- Reused one compiled commit-search highlight pattern per render instead of rebuilding the same regular expression for every highlighted commit field.
- Strengthened worktree file-row colors so hover, current file, multi-selected file, current multi-selected file, and conflict states are easier to distinguish.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/app.js` contains `renderCommitInspector` and `commitSearchPattern`.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/styles.css` contains the updated multi-selected and conflict file-row color rules.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used static checks plus local HTTP/API verification instead.
### Notes
- `public/app.js`: avoids redundant inspector refreshes on commit renders and reuses the commit-search highlight regex for each render.
- `public/styles.css`: updates worktree file-row hover, selected, multi-selected, selected-multi, and conflict color states.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documents the additional render-performance and worktree color refinements.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: refine top-right toolbar UI
### What was done
- Grouped the top-right actions into compact utility, sync, and more-panel controls instead of leaving every button as a separate loose item.
- Changed the "more" panel selector into a single button-like select with "更多" as the default label, removing the old "更多 + 选择" double-label layout.
- Restyled the top-right toolbar area with quieter grouped backgrounds, tighter inner button spacing, clearer hover states, and a softer danger state for force push.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 and includes `topbar-action-group` plus the new "更多" default option.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/styles.css` returns the new `.topbar-action-group`, `.topbar-sync-actions`, `.topbar-more::after`, and scoped top-right danger-hover styles.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used static checks plus local HTTP/API verification instead.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: wraps right-top actions into grouped toolbar sections and simplifies the more-panel select label.
- `public/styles.css`: adds grouped toolbar styling, compact nested button states, and polished more-select styling.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the right-top toolbar UI cleanup for future continuation.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: keep repository path chooser visible
### What was done
- Reworked the top path opener so the path input, recent repository selector, and repository action buttons are separate layout groups.
- Kept the "选择" directory button as a fixed-width action inside the path button group, so it is not squeezed out by the input or recent repository dropdown.
- Moved the medium-width topbar breakpoint earlier and added narrower topbar layouts so the path area and top-right actions do not overlap or deform each other.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 and includes `recent-repo-group`, `path-actions`, and `id="browseRepo"`.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/styles.css` returns `.path-actions`, `.recent-repo-group`, and the earlier responsive topbar breakpoints.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- Headless browser screenshot verification was unavailable because no browser executable was exposed as `msedge`, `chrome`, or `chromium`; in-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: groups the recent repository controls and path action buttons so the directory chooser remains an explicit button.
- `public/styles.css`: updates path opener grid columns, button sizing, and topbar responsive breakpoints to prevent overlap and deformation.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: updates the path selector note with the fixed visible chooser and responsive layout behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-21 - Task: add settings panel
### What was done
- Added a "设置" entry to the top-right "更多" selector and command palette.
- Added a right-side settings panel for browser-local preferences: theme selection, recent repository cleanup, repository directory chooser shortcut, recovery retention policy, and layout width/height reset.
- Wired settings controls to the existing localStorage-backed theme, recent repository, recovery policy, and layout preferences without adding new backend configuration.
### Testing
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 and includes the `settings` option.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/app.js` returns `renderSettingsTab`, `data-settings-action`, and `tabSettings`.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/styles.css` returns `.settings-layout`, `.settings-card`, and `.settings-choice`.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used static checks plus local HTTP/API verification instead.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: adds the settings option to the top-right more selector.
- `public/app.js`: registers the settings tab, renders the settings panel, and handles settings actions.
- `public/styles.css`: adds compact settings panel layout and row styles.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: documents the settings panel and its current browser-local scope.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-28 - Task: split frontend framework files
### What was done
- Split the previous single frontend script into ordered framework layers: `public/js/core.js`, `public/js/api.js`, existing `public/app.js`, and `public/js/bootstrap.js`.
- Moved shared state, DOM handles, constants, API wrapper, and startup sequence out of the legacy feature file while keeping existing feature behavior in place.
- Added the `window.Forkline` namespace so later modules can depend on a stable framework object instead of adding new globals.
- Added `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the loading order and next split targets.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/core.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/js/api.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/app.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/js/bootstrap.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Started the local service and confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 with the new `core.js`, `api.js`, and `bootstrap.js` script order.
- HTTP static resource checks confirmed `/js/core.js`, `/js/api.js`, and `/js/bootstrap.js` return the expected framework markers.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
### Notes
- `public/index.html`: now loads frontend scripts in framework order before startup.
- `public/js/core.js`: contains shared state, constants, DOM handles, and `window.Forkline`.
- `public/js/api.js`: contains the shared API wrapper and exposes `Forkline.api`.
- `public/app.js`: keeps the existing feature implementation and no longer owns shared state, API setup, or startup calls.
- `public/js/bootstrap.js`: owns the startup sequence and exposes `Forkline.start`.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: documents the frontend layers, loading order, and next migration targets.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the framework split for future continuation.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/js/core.js`, `public/js/api.js`, `public/js/bootstrap.js`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-28 - Task: complete frontend module split
### What was done
- Split the remaining legacy frontend feature code out of `public/app.js` into ordered `public/js/app/`, `public/js/features/`, and `public/js/panels/` modules.
- Updated `public/index.html` so the direct browser loading model now loads all feature and panel modules before the compatibility placeholder and bootstrap script.
- Kept `public/app.js` as a small compatibility file only, so new feature work has clear module locations.
- Updated architecture and continuation notes to describe the final split, loading order, and future file placement rules.
### Testing
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/` using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported CRLF normalization warnings for touched text files.
- Static entry verification confirmed all 21 `<script>` paths in `public/index.html` exist on disk.
- HTTP verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` returns 200 and includes the new module script paths.
- HTTP static resource checks confirmed `/js/app/init.js`, `/js/features/branches.js`, `/js/panels/recovery-settings.js`, `/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `/js/app/events.js`, and `/js/bootstrap.js` return 200.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used syntax, static entry, local HTTP, and API verification instead.

## 2026-06-28 - Task: stage selected diff lines
### What was done
- Added line selection to the bottom worktree Diff so added/deleted Diff rows can be selected without checkboxes.
- Added a "暂存所选行" action that stages only selected unstaged Diff rows; paired modification rows stage the delete/add pair together.
- Added a backend `stageSelectedLines` action that rereads the real repository Diff and builds a minimal patch for selected lines before applying it to the index.
- Added `FORKLINE_NO_OPEN=1` for local verification runs that should restart the service without opening a browser automatically.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/` using the bundled Node executable.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git only reported CRLF normalization warnings for touched text files.
- Temporary Git repository API verification passed: selected only the added `line5 added` row and confirmed the cached diff contained that addition while the `line2 changed` modification remained unstaged.
- Temporary Git repository API verification passed: selected the paired delete/add rows for `line2 changed` and confirmed both remaining selected lines moved into the cached diff, leaving no unstaged diff.
- Temporary Git repository API verification passed for an untracked file: selected only the `three` row and confirmed the index contained that selected line without staging the other new-file rows.
- Restarted `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` with `FORKLINE_NO_OPEN=1`; HTTP verification confirmed the page returns 200 without opening a browser automatically.
- HTTP static resource checks confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `/js/app/events.js`, and `/styles.css` return the new line-selection markers.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used syntax, local HTTP/API, and temporary Git repository behavior verification instead.
### Notes
- `server.js`: adds `stageSelectedLines`, selected-line patch generation, operation labeling, and the `FORKLINE_NO_OPEN=1` local startup guard.
- `public/js/core.js`: stores selected Diff line state.
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: renders the selected-line toolbar, selectable Diff rows, selection state, and selected-line staging request.
- `public/js/app/events.js`: routes Diff row clicks and selected-line staging button clicks.
- `public/styles.css`: styles the selected-line toolbar, hover state, and selected Diff rows.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: documents the local no-auto-open verification environment variable.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that Diff selected-line staging is available and content editing remains out of scope.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/js/core.js`, `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `public/js/app/events.js`, `public/styles.css`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-28 - Task: enable selected-line staging in maximized diff
### What was done
- Added selected-line staging controls to the maximized Diff modal for worktree diffs.
- Reused the same selected-line state between the bottom Diff and maximized Diff so row highlights stay in sync.
- Updated the maximized Diff after a selected-line staging action; if no diff remains, the modal closes instead of showing stale content.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/js/app/events.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js` contains `diffModalOptions`, `syncDiffLineSelectionRows`, and `stageSelectedLines`.
- HTTP static resource verification confirmed `/js/app/events.js` contains the `diffModalBody` selected-line click handler.
- In-app Browser visual verification was intentionally skipped because repeated localhost opens can destabilize the Codex session; this task used syntax and local HTTP static verification instead.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: passes line-selection options into the maximized worktree Diff and synchronizes selected rows across both Diff containers.
- `public/js/app/events.js`: handles selected-line clicks and "暂存所选行" inside the maximized Diff body.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that both bottom and maximized Diff support selected-line staging.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `public/js/app/events.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-28 - Task: unstage selected diff lines
### What was done
- Added selected-line unstaging for the staged Diff view, using the same bottom and maximized Diff selection behavior.
- Changed the selected-line toolbar so unstaged Diff shows "暂存所选行" and staged Diff shows "取消暂存所选行".
- After selected-line staging, the workbench now switches to the staged Diff when staged content exists, making the newly staged lines visible immediately.
- After selected-line unstaging, the workbench switches back to the unstaged Diff when worktree content exists.
### Testing
- `node --check server.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- `node --check public/js/app/events.js` passed using the bundled Node executable.
- Temporary Git repository API verification passed: selected only the staged `line5 added` row and confirmed it moved back to the worktree while the staged `line2 changed` modification remained staged.
- Temporary Git repository API verification passed: selected the staged delete/add pair for `line2 changed` and confirmed the cached diff became empty while both changes were present in the worktree diff.
- Restarted `http://127.0.0.1:5177/` with `FORKLINE_NO_OPEN=1`; HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js` contains `unstageSelectedLines`, `取消暂存所选行`, and `selectedDiffLineAction`.
- API verification confirmed `http://127.0.0.1:5177/api/state` returns 200.
### Notes
- `server.js`: adds `unstageSelectedLines` and selected-line patch generation mode for reversing staged lines safely.
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: chooses the correct selected-line action by Diff scope and switches views after staging or unstaging.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the staged selected-line unstaging behavior and automatic view switch.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `server.js`, `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: pull remote and keep right detail order
### What was done
- Pulled `origin/main` from `d87f396` to `e32a801`.
- Preserved the local right detail panel layout intent after the remote frontend module split by moving the selected commit message section above the operation section in the new inspector module.
- Kept the existing operation buttons, history editing area, edit queue, and diff preview behavior unchanged.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/panels/inspector.js` passed.
- `node --check public/app.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
### Notes
- `public/js/panels/inspector.js`: reorders the detail tab markup so commit information appears before commit operations.
- `public/app.js`: kept the remote compatibility placeholder from the module split.
- `progress.md`: resolved the pull/stash conflict and appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/panels/inspector.js` and `progress.md`, or reset back to the pre-pull commit `d87f396` if the remote pull itself must be undone.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: keep selected-line diff view after action
### What was done
- Changed selected-line staging and unstaging so the bottom or maximized Diff stays in the user's current view after the action.
- Kept the automatic fallback to the other Diff side when the current side has no remaining changes.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- Browser verification on a temporary repository confirmed staging one selected line kept the bottom Diff at `view-stay.txt · 未暂存` while unselected lines remained visible.
- Browser verification on a temporary repository confirmed cancelling one selected staged line kept the bottom Diff at `staged-view.txt · 已暂存` while the remaining staged line stayed visible.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: preserves the active Diff scope after selected-line staging or unstaging instead of jumping to the result side.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the current selected-line view retention behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: avoid empty diff after staging a hunk
### What was done
- Added a fallback when loading a worktree Diff: if the requested side returns no lines but the same file still has changes on the other side, Forkline now loads that other side instead.
- This fixes staging the last visible hunk showing "没有可显示的差异" while the file is still present in the change list.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- API verification on a temporary repository confirmed staging the only unstaged hunk makes `scope=unstaged` return 0 Diff lines while `scope=staged` returns the staged Diff with the selected change.
- HTTP verification confirmed the local service still returns 200 for `/` and `/api/state`.
- In-app Browser verification was attempted, but the Browser control connection timed out while loading localhost; API/HTTP verification covered the bug condition directly.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: retries the opposite worktree Diff scope when the requested scope is empty and the file still has changes there.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the empty-Diff fallback behavior after hunk operations.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: refresh staged and unstaged file state accurately
### What was done
- Updated the worktree refresh signature so it distinguishes index status, worktree status, and staged/unstaged flags instead of only the combined display status.
- Changed change-list rows to render scope-specific status text, so a partially staged file can show `工作区 M` in the worktree section and `暂存区 A` or `暂存区 M` in the staged section.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- Frontend function regression check confirmed an unstaged `M` file and staged `M` file now produce different refresh signatures.
- Frontend function regression check confirmed an `AM` file renders as `工作区 M` in the unstaged section and `暂存区 A` in the staged section.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: includes index/worktree status in refresh signatures and renders scope-specific file row status.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the more accurate staged/unstaged refresh and display behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: prevent stale diff fallback without file state
### What was done
- Fixed `fileChangeFlags` so a missing selected file no longer defaults to `hasUnstaged = true`.
- This prevents stale Diff fallback from switching to an unstaged view after the selected file disappears from the working file list.
### Testing
- Boundary regression check confirmed missing file state now returns `hasUnstaged = false`, `hasStaged = false`, and no fallback scope.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- Frontend diff-state regression checks confirmed `AM` files still render differently by section and staged/unstaged `M` files still produce different refresh signatures.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: guards `fileChangeFlags` against missing file state.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the missing-file fallback guard.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: keep file selection aligned after staging
### What was done
- Changed file-row status text to show the section identity directly as `未暂存`, `已暂存`, or `未跟踪`, so the same path in both change sections no longer looks identical.
- Added post-action selection sync for single-file and multi-file staging actions: after staging, unstaging, or discarding, Forkline reselects the file in the latest valid section.
- Kept the existing backend Git state behavior unchanged; this change only fixes the frontend selection and display after refresh.
### Testing
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- `node --check public/js/features/git-actions.js` passed.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- Frontend logic regression check passed: `stageFile` moves selection from `unstaged:<file>` to `staged:<file>`, `unstageFile` moves it back to `unstaged:<file>`, and `MM` status renders different `未暂存` / `已暂存` labels.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: changed scoped file-row labels from raw status text to clearer section labels.
- `public/js/features/git-actions.js`: added selection synchronization after single and batch file actions.
- `public/styles.css`: makes scoped file-row labels visually distinct by section.
- `README.md`: documents that staging actions keep the selected file aligned with its latest section.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records the current staged/unstaged display and selection behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `public/js/features/git-actions.js`, `public/styles.css`, `README.md`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: keep selected row after stage all refresh
### What was done
- Found a remaining selection bug in the top-level "暂存全部" path: the selected file's Diff scope changed to staged, but the change-list selection key was pruned and not recreated.
- Added a render-layer guard so any still-visible `selectedFile` is reattached to the current valid change section after refresh.
- This makes full refreshes, including "暂存全部", keep the list highlight aligned with the bottom Diff.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: rendering a file that moved from `unstaged:a.txt` to staged-only left `selectedChanges = []`.
- Regression check passed after the fix: the same render now leaves `workDiffScope = staged` and `selectedChanges = ['staged:a.txt']`.
- `node --check public/js/features/worktree-changes.js` passed.
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- `node --check public/js/features/git-actions.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/worktree-changes.js` contains `ensureSelectedFileChangeKey`.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/worktree-changes.js`: reattaches the selected file to the current valid staged/unstaged section after pruning stale selection keys.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that single-file, batch, and stage-all paths keep selection aligned.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/worktree-changes.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-29 - Task: scope file context menu for duplicate paths
### What was done
- Found a right-click menu bug for the Git state where the same path appears twice, such as staged deletion plus untracked recreation.
- Changed the file context menu to choose the working-file record that matches the row scope, instead of always taking the first record with the same path.
- This keeps "暂存 / 丢弃" enabled on the worktree row and "取消暂存 / 丢弃已暂存" enabled on the staged row for the duplicate-path case.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: right-clicking the `unstaged` row for duplicate `same.txt` left "暂存" disabled because the menu used the staged deletion record.
- Regression check passed after the fix: the `unstaged` row enables stage/discard worktree and ignore-file actions, while the `staged` row enables unstage/discard-staged and does not expose the untracked ignore action.
- API verification on a temporary Git repository confirmed Git/Forkline returns two `same.txt` records for staged deletion plus untracked recreation.
- `node --check public/js/features/context-menus.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/context-menus.js` contains `contextWorkingFileInfo`.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/context-menus.js`: resolves file information by the row scope before enabling file-menu actions.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records duplicate-path context-menu behavior.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/context-menus.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-30 - Task: open context diff in the clicked file section
### What was done
- Found a right-click "查看对照" bug for files that have both unstaged and staged changes.
- The context menu previously selected the file but kept the old Diff scope, so right-clicking an already-staged row could still open the unstaged Diff.
- Updated the file context menu Diff action to inherit the clicked row scope before loading the worktree Diff.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: `runFileContextAction('diff')` with `context.scope = staged` loaded `scope = unstaged`.
- Regression check passed after the fix: the staged context row loads `scope = staged`.
- Regression check also passed for the reverse case: the unstaged context row loads `scope = unstaged` even if the previous Diff scope was staged.
- `node --check public/js/features/context-menus.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/context-menus.js` contains the scope handoff for context Diff.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/context-menus.js`: sets `state.workDiffScope` from the clicked row scope before loading file Diff from the context menu.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that right-click "查看对照" opens the corresponding staged or unstaged Diff.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/context-menus.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-30 - Task: enable hunk actions in maximized diff
### What was done
- Found that maximized worktree Diff reused selected-line controls but did not expose the same hunk actions shown in the bottom Diff.
- Added hunk actions to maximized worktree Diff rendering.
- Routed hunk-action clicks inside the maximized Diff body through the existing hunk operation flow, and refreshes or closes the modal after the action.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: `diffModalOptions()` for a worktree Diff did not include `hunkActions`.
- Regression check passed after the fix: maximized worktree Diff options include `hunkActions = true`.
- Render regression check passed: maximized unstaged Diff HTML contains `data-hunk-action="stageHunk"` and `暂存此块`.
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- `node --check public/js/app/events.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js` contains `hunkActions: true` and `/js/app/events.js` handles modal hunk-action clicks.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: adds hunk actions to maximized worktree Diff and refreshes the modal after hunk operations.
- `public/js/app/events.js`: handles hunk-action clicks inside the maximized Diff body.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that maximized Diff supports both hunk and selected-line operations.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `public/js/app/events.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-30 - Task: use modal file for maximized diff operations
### What was done
- Found a follow-up edge case in maximized Diff operations: hunk and selected-line actions depended on global `selectedFile`.
- Added a shared file resolver that prefers the current worktree `activeDiff.path`, then falls back to `selectedFile`.
- The operation now reselects the modal file before calling the existing hunk or selected-line action flow.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: maximized hunk action with `activeDiff.path = modal-file.txt` and empty `selectedFile` did not send `modal-file.txt` to the API.
- Regression check passed after the fix: maximized hunk action sends `file = modal-file.txt` and updates `selectedFile`.
- Regression check passed for maximized selected-line action: it sends `file = modal-lines.txt` and updates `selectedFile`.
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js` contains `activeWorktreeDiffFile`.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: resolves maximized hunk and selected-line operations from the active worktree Diff path before falling back to the selected file.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that maximized Diff operations use the current modal file.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.

## 2026-06-30 - Task: render diff actions by current scope
### What was done
- Found a duplicate-path rendering bug for staged deletion plus untracked recreation.
- Hunk and selected-line buttons were looking up file state through the global `workDiffScope`, so rendering a staged Diff while the global scope was unstaged could hide `取消暂存此块`.
- Changed hunk and selected-line action rendering to resolve file state using the Diff scope currently being rendered.
### Testing
- Reproduction check failed before the fix: `workDiffHunkActionButtons('same.txt', 'staged', 0)` returned no staged hunk action when global scope was unstaged.
- Regression check passed after the fix: staged Diff renders `data-hunk-action="unstageHunk"` and untracked Diff renders `data-hunk-action="stageHunk"`.
- Regression check passed for selected-line actions: staged Diff returns `unstageSelectedLines`, untracked Diff returns `stageSelectedLines`.
- `node --check public/js/features/diff-workbench.js` passed.
- `node --check` passed for all 21 frontend JavaScript files under `public/`.
- `node --check server.js` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed, with only Windows LF/CRLF notices.
- HTTP static verification confirmed `/js/features/diff-workbench.js` resolves selected file info with the current render scope.
### Notes
- `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`: renders hunk and selected-line actions from the current Diff scope instead of the global worktree scope.
- `docs/CONTINUE.md`: records that duplicate-path Diff buttons follow the active Diff section.
- `progress.md`: appended this implementation and verification record.
- Rollback: revert this task's edits in `public/js/features/diff-workbench.js`, `docs/CONTINUE.md`, and `progress.md`, or revert the commit created for this task after it is committed.
